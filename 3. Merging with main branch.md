# Objective
Currently, we have two branches
- main
- branch_a
We need to pull the changes from main branch to our branch_a as the other user might have pushed few changes in main branch.

# Steps to achieve the objective
- Step-0: Verify the tree is clean
```git status```
This must output ```nothing to commit, the tree is clean```
- Step-1: Fetch latest remote state
Initially, we have to the fetch the remote state status
```git fetch origin```
    - This updates the local repository with latest change in the remote repository of our branch.

- Step-2: Switching to feature branch
    - Since we are pulling the changes from main branch to branch_a, we have to be in the branch_a;
    - ```git branch``` : ensure the branch is branch_a
    - ```git checkout branch_a```: if not residing in branch_a
    - ```git branch```: to check again

- Step-3: Merge main branch into branch_a
    - ```git merge origin main```: To merge the changes of main branch in branch_a

- Step-4: If conflicts appear(normal)
    - ```git status``` : Check the conflicted files
    - we can find the conflicted files
    - Open each file to resolve manually
    - remove conflict markers and then ```git add <resolved-files>``` --> ```git commit```

- Step-5: Verify merge correctness
    - ```git log --oneline --graph --decorate --max-count=15```
    - we can see ; merge commit and history

- Step-6: The mandatory step ; Run tests
    - ```pytest -q```
    - Successful output looks like : ```...............................x                                              [100%]
31 passed, 1 xfailed in 168.25s (0:02:48)```

- Step-7: Push the updated branch_a to remote
    - ```git push origin branch_a```


## Summary
- fetch → checkout feature → merge main → resolve → test → push
